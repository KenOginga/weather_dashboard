# Weather Dashboard

## Using Server-Side APIs to code a Weather Dashboard

This challenge was to build a weather dashboard that will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS. It involves retrieving data from another third-party API and using it in the context of their own by making requests with specific parameters to the URL. 

The [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/api) was used to retrieve weather data for cities. The documentation includes a section called "How to start" that will provide basic setup and usage instructions.
